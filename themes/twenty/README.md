Usage
-----

This theme has 3 content sections on each page. So, I created two related posts sections. One section is in the sidebar, 
the other is below the post content. To place content on a page sidebar, set the post category, and to make content appear 
below the content, set the tag. 

    tags = [
      "go",
      "golang",
      "hugo",
      "development",
    ]
    categories = [
      "Development",
      "golang",
    ]

The theme also gives you the option to display a theme with a left-sidebar, right-sidebar 
or no sidebar. To use these styles on a post, set the theme and left sidebar front matter.

  theme = "left-sidebar"
  theme = "right-sidebar"
  theme = "no-sidebar"
