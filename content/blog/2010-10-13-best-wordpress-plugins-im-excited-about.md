The short list of Plugins I'm excited about:

  1. Google [Analytics by Yoast][1] loads your Google analytics asynchronously to speed up your page loads.
  2. Yoast's Best WordPress [SEO plugin][2] recommended by [Hobo SEO][3]
  3. Amazon [Affiliate Linker][4] adds your Amazon Affiliate code to all amazon links on your site.

I'll keep adding to this list as I find more plugins to play with.
