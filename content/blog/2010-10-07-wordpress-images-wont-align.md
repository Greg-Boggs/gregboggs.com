WordPress relies on themes to allow users to align images and create captions. If your theme doesn't support alignment or captions, you'll find adding images to WordPress to be very frustrating.

WordPress[ provides documentation][1] to fix this problem, but it's requires that you edit your theme's CSS file:

> .aligncenter, div.aligncenter {  
> display: block;  
> margin-left: auto;  
> margin-right: auto;  
> }  
> .alignleft {  
> float: left;  
> }  
> .alignright {  
> float: right;  
> } 

### Backup your Theme First

Before you edit your WordPress theme, always make sure you have a backup because WordPress editor does not allow you to undo mistakes.
