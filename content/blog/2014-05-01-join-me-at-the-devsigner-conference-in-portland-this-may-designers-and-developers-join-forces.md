**Devsigner is celebrating the cross-overs, the multi-disciplinarians, the coders who paint and the designers who send pull requests — and those who want to develop some new left-right brain skills.**

We’re looking for folks to break out of their familiar meetup silos and apply their knowledge across the crafts of development and design.
