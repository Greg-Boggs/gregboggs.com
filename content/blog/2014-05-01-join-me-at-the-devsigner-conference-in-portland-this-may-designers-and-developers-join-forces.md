**Devsigner is celebrating the cross-overs, the multi-disciplinarians, the coders who paint and the designers who send pull requests — and those who want to develop some new left-right brain skills.**

We’re looking for folks to break out of their familiar meetup silos and apply their knowledge across the crafts of development and design.

  * artists who are tired of ugly or unusable websites
  * branding experts who want to tell developers a story about the cobbler’s children
