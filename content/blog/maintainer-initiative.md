With the launch of Drupal 9, the community is rallying to update all of the community contributed modules from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9. This work is often just a single line of code to tell Drupal that the module supports 9. But, for older, out of date modules, the work required to get to Drupal 9 is a bigger effort. Some of these modules haven't been updated in 4 years.

I'm not to complain about problems without solutions. So, how do we fix it?

## The Maintainer's Initiative!

Together with [Damien Mckenna](https://www.damienmckenna.com/), we've started a new Drupal project called [Maintainers] (https://www.drupal.org/project/maintainers). Our goal is to support as much of Drupal contrib as we can while focusing on issued marked "reviewed and tested by the community". Instead of starting a new module, we're picking up where others left off.

## Finishing Drupal 8 Ports

Beyond curating releases for older Drupal 8 modules, I also hope to finish Drupal 7 to 8 ports that aren't quite finished yet. Most recently, I assisted with releases for of AddtoCal and ShareThis. My next todo is a release for Styleguide and Author Pane.
