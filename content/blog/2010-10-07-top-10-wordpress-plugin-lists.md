The popularity of WordPress makes it an amazing tool for making successful websites. However, WordPress does a terrible job at cleaning up their plugin and theme directory. So, finding good plugins is challenging. One of the most common services I do for my clients is select plugins. As an example, searching for *SEO plugins* brings up 30 pages of plugins or over 600 plugins! Fortunately, the plugin most people use, All-In-One SEO, is near the top. Yet, many users select dubious SEO plugins that can often have disastrous consequences.

### Why Top 10 Lists are Important

A company I consult for had downloaded an interesting search engine optimization plugin, but after looking through the plugin I realized the plugin purposefully removed their homepage from Google! The plugin did nothing to notify users of it&#8217;s disastrous behavior. Luckily, deleting the plugin fixed the problem quickly. When selecting WordPress plugins, it&#8217;s important to get recommendations. So, I&#8217;ve a list of lists by the leaders in WordPress development.

### The Top Lists

  1. Prelovac&#8217;s [10 hidden gems list][1] has some great plugins not on other lists
  2. Seo Chick&#8217;s [top 10 list][2] covers a pretty standard set of plugins
  3. Lorelle&#8217;s [mind blowing list][3] has way too many plugins, but it&#8217;s worth reading
  4. Michael Gray&#8217;s [SEO plugins list][4] has more than just SEO plugins
  5. WordPress.org has [most popular list][5] so you can follow the crowd
  6. Mashable posted a [SEO plugins list][6] that looks rather bland, but [automatic links][7] looks good
  7. Interesting [Ajax plugins list][8] that has some nifty plugins.

### What Am I Using?

  * Akismet to block spam comments
  * All in One SEO Pack to fix my page titles
  * Contact Form 7 for my contact page
  * Google Analyticator to add analytics, but I&#8217;m looking for a plugin that does &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; loading
  * WordPress.com Stats so I can get a pretty graph of hits in real time
