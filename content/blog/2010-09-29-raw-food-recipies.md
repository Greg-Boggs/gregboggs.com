<a href="http://www.gregboggs.com/raw-food-recipies/addictedtoveggies/" rel="attachment wp-att-125"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-125" title="addictedtoveggies" src="http://www.gregboggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/addictedtoveggies.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="165" /></a>One of my favorite bloggers is a raw food blogger named Addicted to Veggies (ATV). She recently mentioned wanting to earn income for the hard work she puts into her amazing original [raw food recipes][1]. So, I started thinking about keywords for her blog. Later that week, I came across a raw food site called from Sad to Raw that had a banner at the bottom advertising, &#8220;#3 for the search Raw Food Recipes&#8221;. I thought, wow that&#8217;s perfect for ATV! Even if you&#8217;re not into raw food, you should [follow Addicted to Veggies on Twitter][2] because her recipes are amazing, healthy, fun, and beautiful.

### Finding Raw Food Keywords

So, I used the [Google keyword tool][3] to search for the phrases raw food recipes and [raw vegan recipes][1]. I set the search to &#8220;exact match&#8221; and I was quickly amazed by how many people were searching for these terms. While the other websites in the searches are optimized, ATV has a great blog, and she draws a lot of links, attention, and support from her fellow bloggers. She certainly has better recipes than the other sites listed.

### How to Rank for Keywords

So, to take advantage of [raw food recipes][1], she should title her home page, Raw Food Recipes by Addicted to Veggies. If she doesn&#8217;t want to place her brand second, then she should create a post titled &#8220;Raw Food Recipes&#8221; and link to it in a couple of places on her blog&#8217;s home page. The next step is to get as many links pointing to her website to say &#8220;raw food recipes&#8221; or a variation on that theme like &#8220;raw vegan recipes&#8221;. A few short emails to her close friends linking to her should do the trick.

There are many great keywords to use for a raw food blog to use here are a few good ones:

  * vegan raw recipes
  * raw food diet recipes
  * simple raw food recipes
  * quick raw food recipes
  * best raw food recipes
  * raw food diet menu
  * raw food dessert recipes
  * raw food breakfast recipes

*Note to ATV: if you create a sub-page for raw food recipes, let me know and I&#8217;ll update the links in this post to point directly to that page.
