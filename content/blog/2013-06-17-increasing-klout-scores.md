Does LinkedIn ever send you messages that aren't spam? Well, anyway, while deleting my LinkedIn spam, I saw one of the largest SEO firms advertising an SEO manager position that required a Klout Score of 50. And, I thought, well that's lame! Who cares about Klout? Then I thought, could I hack my social media profiles to increase my Klout score without much work?

## Hacking Your Klout Profile Score

As someone who [does not use social media][1], outside of using Facebook to look at family photos, you'd think I would have a hard time getting a Klout Score of 50. However, after only 20 minutes of effort over a couple of days, I've managed to create a significant increase in my score.

Creating the increase turned out to be pretty simple. Once you log in, Klout has access to your private Facebook posts so your mother liking your posts on Facebook shoots your score way up. But, what if your mother doesn't like you? Tweet Klout Support and other social media support accounts that you know you will likely get a reply from.

Try, tweeting &#8220;@kloutsupport klout support is fantastic&#8221;. Even a single response from a popular account will blossom your score quickly. Lastly, make sure all your networks are accounted for. I've noticed my Google+ account has never showed up on my Klout profile&#8230; so I contacted[@KloutSupport][2] and here was their advice&#8230; get someone to comment on one of your posts to make your profile count!

## Add all the networks except ones that don't count

Don't use Instagram? Create one and get your  family to like your stuff. Hate Four Square? Yeah, no one (except Klout) cares about your check-ins, but a few interactions get you a strong bonus. A small interaction from is worth a huge boost to Klout. Also, make sure you get at least 2 or 3 friends to give you K+ points. I know, I know, it's stupid. No one uses K+, but Klout gives huge weight to their own network. But, there's some bad news. So far Klout seems not to register these networks for me:

  * Bing
  * Flickr
  * Blogger
  * Tumblr
  * WordPress.com

## Get easy K+ by trading

Too lazy to bug your friends and family to give you K+? Easy, trade K+ with another marketing Klout user. I always return K+ to anyone who gives me K: <http://klout.com/#/gregory_boggs>.

## Make Google+ count in your score

> Hi Greg,

> I apologize for the confusion. Please note that Google + stats will only populate from public posts within the last 90 days when you receive +1s, comments, and shares from other users. I looked up your account and saw that you have 0 public posts within the last 90 days which means there are no +1s, comments, and shares from other users, so your stats are displayed properly. I’ve attached a screenshot of what I see when I view your Google + account.

My G+ profile hasn't done much for my score still, but all my other networks have registered. It seems to be a bug in Klout's measuring of G+, but they said it can take several days, so we'll see.

## Score Increase Results

Well, none of my G+ followers registered, but I've managed a 33 point gain. The trick? Added my partner's Instragram. My last test will be to use some extra Klout accounts to see if passing K+ to myself improves my score.

## Problems with Klout

  * An unpopular Twitter account you haven't used in 2 years is worth more than other networks.
  * Your websites only count if you host them on Blogger, WordPress or Tumblr.
  * Your family on Facebook count way too much.
  * People who circle you on Google+ don't count.

You can add Facebook pages that you admin to your Klout profile, but it disables your Facebook profile. Lastly, spamming a few posts to Twitter and dropping a comment on two on your own G+ gives a quick boost because Klout score is largely influenced by activity.
