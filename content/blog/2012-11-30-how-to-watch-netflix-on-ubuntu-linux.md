I've only been waiting for this since the day I first purchased a netflix account&#8230; The performance wasn't so great for me&#8230; but after shrinking the window and disabling the useless &#8220;HD&#8221;, it was watchable&#8230; Not as fast as the iPhone, could be related to the fact that I'm using the built in Free drivers and a 2d desktop.

> Yesterday, developer and programmer extraordinaire Erich Hoover and I spent several hours working out all of the Netflix Desktop kinks. Most users will have no problems with installation now.
> 
> Here is how to install the Netflix Desktop App on Ubuntu. Open a terminal and run these commands:
> 
> **sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ehoover/compholio**
> 
> **sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install netflix-desktop**
