I haven't been able to get my Ubuntu laptop on Windows network for years. This is the best walk through I've found. Unfortunately, my apt-get is broken&#8230; so I couldn't do apt-get install win-bind. But, one of the other steps solved the problem.

smbtree returns:  
cli\_start\_connection: failed to connect to JANES<20> (0.0.0.0). Error NT\_STATUS\_UNSUCCESSFUL

Walk through that hasn't resolved the problem yet:

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart does not work in Ubuntu 10.04! However, following the walk through and rebooting completely did work! I can browse networks again!
