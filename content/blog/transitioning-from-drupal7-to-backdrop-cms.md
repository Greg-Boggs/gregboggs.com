This is a guest post by [Kana Patrick](https://kanapatrick.cm/en) who is a world-class Drupal migration expert.

As the impending end of life for Drupal 7 draws near, the necessity for website owners to consider their migration options becomes increasingly urgent. While the prevailing trend in the Drupal community leans towards transitioning to Drupal 10 to leverage its modern features, some are hesitant due to the associated costs.

In this discourse, we advocate for a different approach by presenting compelling reasons to shift your website from Drupal 7 to Backdrop CMS if you have not already done so.
## Embracing Backdrop CMS

Backdrop CMS emerges as a noteworthy contender in the realm of content management systems, originating as a fork from Drupal 7. Conceived in 2013 by Nate **Lampton and Jen Lampton**, this platform sought to streamline and enhance the foundational code of Drupal 7 while maintaining cost-effectiveness for users.

The reluctance of many website owners to depart from Drupal 7 may stem from financial constraints, sentimental attachment to the platform, or various other factors. However, the looming conclusion of Drupal 7's lifecycle, coupled with the cessation of community support, prompts a reevaluation of alternatives.

A viable solution lies in transitioning directly to Backdrop CMS, offering a cost-effective migration path that preserves much of the original project's structure since both systems share a common API rooted in Drupal 7.

Despite its nascent community, the Backdrop project signifies a supportive ecosystem that can aid in the growth of your endeavors, a valuable asset for those seeking assistance and collaboration.

## Advantages of Migrating to Backdrop CMS

- Backdrop CMS inherits the strengths of Drupal 7 while introducing distinct features.
- It boasts modest system requirements, translating to affordable hosting solutions.
- Unique functionalities absent in Drupal core are seamlessly integrated into Backdrop's core framework.
- Backdrop furnishes a robust foundation with extensive extensibility through contributed modules, harnessing the full capabilities of Drupal.
- Scheduled updates and version releases provide a predictable timeline, mitigating uncertainties surrounding module updates.

In conclusion, **Backdrop CMS** emerges as a compelling alternative for Drupal 7 projects facing obsolescence. Evaluating the migration effort from **Drupal 7 to 10** against a transition to Backdrop CMS presents an intriguing comparison. **Should you require guidance or support in your migration journey to Backdrop CMS, do not hesitate to reach out for assistance.**
